# Using Deep Learning for Classification of Lung Cancer on CT Images in Ardabil Province 
Classification of Lung Cancer using Xception


In the past, doctors had to physically locate the region they thought could have lung cancer. Several studies have shown that manual segmentation is time-consuming and dependent on the operator and instrument. To aid healthcare providers in making an early diagnosis of lung cancer, an algorithm known as the XCEPTION Based Classification for Lung Cancer (XCEPTION) has been created. XCEPTION enhances the categorization of lung cancer lesions by using a neural network to assist doctors in diagnosing lung cancer. Medical pictures of lung cancer in malignant, benign, and healthy people may all be classified by XCEPTION. Each and every ethical guideline has been followed while doing research for this study. This approach uses a convolutional neural network to categorize lung cancer in order to help medical practitioners identify lung cancer lesions. With precision and sensitivity, XCEPTION can identify incoming medical photos as belonging to cancer patients or healthy people.



<h2> Dataset </h2>
The data set is available at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ardabil, Iran (https://arums.ac.ir/imam/fa) (Table 1). Over 400 people participated in this project, and 5,000 cancer images and 5,000 normal images of people with lung cancer were collected. Lastly, simulation results based on Python and Jupyter Notebook are used to assess the system. For training and testing, we divided our dataset into two distinct sections. The test data is used for our model's ultimate assessment, while the training data is used to train the model. Our suggested approach consists of many stages. Figure 2 provides an sample of the cancer and normal dataset.

<h2> Methods </h2>
The goal of this work is to improve the categorization accuracy of lung lesions as nodules or non-nodules by introducing a unique 2D deep CNN architecture named XCEPTION. XCEPTION is composed of three distinct layer types: the fully connected layer, the pooling layer, and the convolutional layer. A convolutional layer applies 2D convolution operations to each input image. These layers have the ability to extract features from the input image throughout the training process. Deeper layers are able to identify higher abstraction levels from attributes. Operating on distinct feature channels, a pooling layer aggregates surrounding feature values into a single value. As a result, it reduces the quantity of parameters that may be trained, controls overfitting, and greatly reduces training time. Figure 3 provides an overview of the suggested methods.

Xception Architecture
Xception is a convolutional neural network that is 71 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The Structure of Xception Algorithm showed in Figuer 4. As a series of stages: input, convolution, and pooling layers.

<h2> Conlusion </h2>
 Techniques for self-diagnosis of lung cancer are crucial because, during the last several decades, early identification of lung cancer by chest tomography (CT) scans has been a significant concern Ardabil because, correctly diagnosing malignant lung nodules, may considerably prolong patient survival. The remarkable structural similarities between benign and malignant nodules provide a considerable obstacle to the correct detection of early-stage lung cancer. Reducing false positive and negative outcomes in lung cancer detection is the primary goal. For many applications, picture recognition and classification have improved thanks to recent developments in convolutional neural network (CNN) models.  
Since using medical imaging technologies for primary lung cancer screening may increase the effectiveness of diagnosis [48]. We introduced a comprehensive learning-based approach for the automated detection of lung cancer in this work [56]. The suggested approach achieved the best performance, according to the experimental data, with 94.01% accuracy, 96.45% sensitivity, and 91.48% specificity. 
Future study aims to start a project in Ardabil province (Iran), Ardabil Imam Khomeini Hospital, to detect Metastasis breast cancer. This is based on studies done by researchers in cancer diagnosis with the use of artificial intelligence in the future.
