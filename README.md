# Automated-Classification-of-Lung-Cancer-Types-from-Cytological-Images-Using-Deep-Convolutional-Neura
Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Currently, in the differential diagnosis of lung cancer, accurate classification of cancer types (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma) is required. However, improving the accuracy and stability of diagnosis is challenging.  In this project, we developed an automated classification scheme for lung cancers presented in ct images using a deep convolutional neural network.  In the results obtained, approximately 91% of the images were classified correctly, which is on par with the accuracy of cytotechnologists and pathologists. Thus, the developed scheme is useful for classification of lung cancers from microscopic images.
